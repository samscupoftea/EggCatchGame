# EggCatchGame
This is my game project for my 2023 application to FAC bootcamp. 
Game Summary: Egg And Cup 

Catch the falling eggs in your cup using the left and right arrow keys. If 5 or more eggs hit the ground it’s game over. The person who can last the longest gains the highest score. 

Plan: 

1. Create canvas of the game in JS. DONE! 
2. Create cup sprite using constructor and draw () fill.Rect. DONE 
3. Using JS, code in the left and right event listener commands.
4. Now add egg sprite(s). 
5. I know how to key in a form of gravity into a single sprite. However, I will need to key in a slower fall rate. 
6. Figure out a way to duplicate the single sprite eggs so that a number of them are falling. 
7. Perhaps use Math.random in order to generate the ever-changing falling eggs’ starting positions.
